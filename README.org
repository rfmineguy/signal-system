* Signal System
- Made as a small hobby/curiousity project for me, as I've always wanted to develop an event/signal system from the ground up.
* Features
- Makes use of function pointers as callbacks for the signals to call
- Custom lambda function expressions are supported
- Custom user data able to be passed in to listener functions through an Emit function call

* Why?
- This simple API enables the programmer to subscribe their functions to certain signal names
- When a signal is emitted, every function attached to it is invoked

* Usage
Dispatcher::Subscribe(function, "signal-name");

Dispatcher::Emit("signal-name");

** see src/main.cpp for examples
