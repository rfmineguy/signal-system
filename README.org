* Signal System
** Made as a small hobby/curiousity project for me, as I've always wanted to develop an event/signal system from the ground up.
* Features
** Makes use of function pointers as callbacks for the signals to call
** Custom lambda function expressions are supported
** Custom user data able to be passed in to listener functions through a dispatch call
